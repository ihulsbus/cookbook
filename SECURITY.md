## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is not something taken lightly. if you found a security issue then please raise an issue in this repository. 
As this tool is build and supported in my spare time, response times can differ. you can expect a response within a week.
Depending on my time available a resolution can follow shortly thereafter or take a bit longer.
